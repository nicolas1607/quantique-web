## Encore.js
[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/encore.png?compact=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/encore/)

This is an MVC framework for node.js that I'm building. I've authored 3 modules specifically for this project,
and you can find them on npm and github:  

* Runway - the router  
* FileFetcher - project file loader  
* Easyioc - inversion of control module  

Current Features List:

* Inversion of control dependency loading  
* Cleanest routing syntax ever
* Route groups  
* Route wildcards  
* RESTful controllers  
* Filters on routes or controllers  
* View templating _(any 3rd party templating library)_  
* Performance optimized view rendering  
* Flexible recursive project loading
